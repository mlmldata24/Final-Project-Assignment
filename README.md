## MS263: Data Analysis Techniques in Marine Science
### Final project timeline

* April 13 - Preliminary analysis due (part of HW6)
* May 4 - Project draft (graded only on reproducibility, feedback given on all aspects)
* May 18 - Final project due, presentations (finals week)

### Final project description

##### Project components:
The final project git repository should contain:

1.	Jupyter notebook (like a paper, but with code showing analysis)
  * See this [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) guide for tips on formatting markdown cells with headers, links, images and equations. This markdown syntax can also be used to format your README.md file.
  * The Jupyter notebook should have the following sections:
    *	Introduction
    * Description of methods and data sources
    * Results (including code, figures and descriptions)
    *	Conclusions
    *	Ideas for future work
    * References
2.	README.md file describing:
  *	Steps needed to run the analysis code on another computer
  *	Location of data and acknowledgement of source
  *	Dependencies
  *	Location of data in repository, or how to access data
3.  Python tools
  * A .py file (or files) that containing useful functions for analysis


##### Submission format:
*	Git repository (see above)
*	Presentation: 12 minutes + time for questions. Same sections as notebook except for code. References do not need to be in separate slide.

##### Grading criteria:
1.	Reproducibility – another person should be able to run your code, and understand how it works [10 points]
  *	Detailed readme file (see above) [4 points]
  *	Git repository and Jupyter notebook contain all necessary components (see above) [4 points]
  *	Git repository is organized and does not contain unnecessary files (hint: use a [.gitignore file](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/gitignore) ) [2 points]
2.	Depth of scientific analysis [10 points]
*	Raw data plotted to show variability in space and/or time [1 points]
*	Visual comparisons show relationships between different variables [2 points]
*	Calculations go beyond raw data (examples: quality control, subsets of data created, variables combined in model calculations) [4 points]
*	Appropriate statistical analysis performed to address hypotheses (note: credit given for identifying correct approach, not statistical significance) [3 points]
3.	Presentation: Professional delivery, uses effective graphics, and does not use unnecessary text. [5 points]
4.	Demonstration that the topic is important (i.e. something that others will care about) [5 points]
5.	Completeness of description of the scientific question being investigated [5 points]
6.	Clarity of writing, logical progression of ideas [5 points]
7.	Proper citation of outside references from peer-reviewed literature [5 points]
8.	Clarity and relevance of information presented in figures [5 points]
